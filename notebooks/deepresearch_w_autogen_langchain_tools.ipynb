    "# Orchestrate Multiple-Agents for High-Quality Research with AutoGen and LangChain Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases how to harness the combined power of **AutoGen** and **LangChain** tools to automate and elevate deep research workflows. At its core, the system coordinates a network of specialized agents—each executing a distinct role in the research and report generation workflow. Together, these agents collect data, analyze findings, and produce polished, insight-driven reports.\n",

    "  Gathers information using tools like `wiki_search` and `duckduckgo_search`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **🧪 Critic Agent**  \n",
    "  Reviews the research plan, gathered evidence, and drafted reports.  \n",
    "  → Provides feedback to enforce analytical rigor and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **✍️ Editor Agent**  \n",
    "  Refines the final report's language, structure, and presentation.  \n",
    "  → Ensures clarity, polish, and alignment with stakeholder expectations.\n"

    "  - Example queries: \"renewable energy market trends\", \"Federal Reserve policy history\"\n",

    "- **duckduckgo_search**: Use for current events, recent developments, market data, and diverse perspectives  \n",
